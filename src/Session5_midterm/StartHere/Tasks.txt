Welcome to midterm review practice.

I tried to guess what will be in the files for midterm and
added a little cherry on top of it to challenge you just a bit.

Two packages:
-Character
-Pet

First, start with Pet package.
1. Look at Pet class.
2. Look at Dog class. Check out constructor, to string and voice methods.
3. Implement Cat class in the likeness of Dog class. Be sure to follow the skeleton comment
in Cat class file
4. Test your creation in PetTester class.

Secondly, if you still have time, look at Character package.
1. Look at AnimeCharacter class.
2. Look at CharacterTester class. See the order of constructor parameters.
3. Uncomment Commoner and Mage (I had to comment them to allow PetTask package compile and run).
4. Implement Commoner and Mage classes to match skeleton. Some methods were implemented for you already.
