Hello everyone.

Today we will practice reading files with some fun exercise.
Have you heard about Caesar Cipher? This is a very old way of encrypting messages

It is operating on a modified alphabet where every letter is shifted to the left against original alphabet
You can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher
Plain	A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z
Cipher	X	Y	Z	A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W
this is an example of shift 23.  Shift of 26 would make one circle and put all letters back to its original place.
It is not secure at all, there are only 25 combinations possible to crack this code.

I've prepared for you some files with secret messages. Our job today is to "crack" them.
To make it easier, I put shift value in the very beginning of a line and separated it with a space.
The reset of the line is the encrypted message.
I also made two helpful methods for you to encode and decode messages.
They are both static methods of CipherHelper:
CipherHelper.decodeCaesarCipher(<encrypted message>, <shift>)

So what do we do?
1. Make a method to read a file and get back the text from it as a String.
2. write a method to get shift value from that string
3. write a method to get encrypted message value from that string (you don't have to do it, the decoder still would do it's job, but this is a good exercise for you)
4. decode the messages and be proud of yourself, hacker.
5. Hack Russians. Just kidding, they've already hacked you. (It is also a joke)
