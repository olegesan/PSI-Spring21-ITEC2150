Polymorphism
After figuring it out with inheritance and relationships we move to another important
subject of this chapter - polymorphism.

Our task today will be a little different from what we do usually. We will look at
already written code and try to identify the relationship, find errors, and fix them.

TODO:
1. Look at your IDE and tell us of different errors that you see. Please mention only one error
per person. Think of ways they can be solved.
2. Implement displayInstalledApps method in Phone class.
3. Look at Reddit class that inherits from App. It has few custom fields that are unique to
Reddit class. You should finish the custom constructor that can set custom values for *karma* and
*username*
4.Run PhoneTester main method to test session4 code. Do you see all the information about all the installed apps?
Address other students with ideas on how to fix that.
