    Write SpaceShipEngine abstract class to store engine values here and implement compareTo method.
    compareTo should compare the ratio of weight to power, i.e. weight is 6 and power is 100
     then ratio is 6/100 = 0.06 If weight is 9 and power is 100, ratio is 9/100 = 0.09
     the smaller the ratio the more powerful is the engine.
