What is inheritance? Why do we like it? How do you implement it in Java?
this session's tasks:
TODO 1. Create a child class to Phone and make it to your choice, i.e. "iPhone", "Galaxy S", "Pixel" (my favorite)
- What should its constructor look like? What parameters will be predefined in this child class?
TODO 2. Create another child class to Phone.
TODO 3. Add more attributes to App class: size, developer.
- most likely you will have to fix some error in PhoneTester and adjust code in toString method in App class file.
TODO 4. Create some child classes to App class. Make them to be after your favorite apps.
- What should their constructor look like? What parameters will be predefined?
TODO 5. In PhoneTester instantiate at least one phone after one of the classes that you made.
*** this might be tricky ***
Also, instantiate at least two apps after your custom classes. And try installing them using install method.
